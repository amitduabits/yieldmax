# YieldMax Technical Architecture

## Overview

YieldMax is a decentralized yield optimization protocol that automatically allocates user funds across multiple DeFi protocols to maximize returns while managing risk.

## System Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer

1. **Core Contracts**
   - `YieldMaxVault`: ERC-4626 compliant vault for user deposits
   - `StrategyEngine`: AI-powered strategy selection and execution
   - `CrossChainManager`: CCIP-based cross-chain operations

2. **Integration Layer**
   - Protocol adapters for Aave, Compound, Yearn, Curve
   - Chainlink automation for rebalancing
   - Chainlink Functions for real-time data

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Tech Stack**
   - Next.js 14 with App Router
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Wagmi/Viem for Web3 interaction
   - RainbowKit for wallet connection

2. **State Management**
   - React Query for server state
   - Local state with React hooks
   - Web3 state via Wagmi

### Data Flow

1. User deposits USDC into YieldMax Vault
2. Strategy Engine analyzes current yields across protocols
3. Funds are allocated to optimal protocol
4. Chainlink Automation monitors and rebalances
5. Users can withdraw anytime with earned yield

## Security Considerations

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin security libraries
- Reentrancy guards on all external functions
- Access control for privileged operations
- Emergency pause functionality
- Withdrawal limits to prevent bank runs

## Gas Optimization

- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized for L2 deployment
